## üìã Requirements

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**
>
> This repo is a container repository that uses submodules of other github repositories and a part of an MVP system. For the best experience, it is recommended to run all 3 systems altogether:
>
> - üì± [Frontend](https://github.com/Hankaji/GDGDoc-Aegis-Frontend) ‚Äì Recommended for full functionality and UI interactions testing
> - üñ•Ô∏è [Backend](https://github.com/DankoFox/aegis-backend) ‚Äì Required Backend Operations
> - üß† [AI](https://github.com/nmquan1/aegis-pipeline) - Require for some features such as auto-tagging
>
> Ensure that the backend, frontend, and AI pipeline can communicate over the same local network.

Each submodule will reside in its own directory within this repository. You can navigate into these directories to work on them.

A detail instruction on how to setup these systems are already well documented it their own repositories, please check the [Frontend](https://github.com/Hankaji/GDGDoc-Aegis-Frontend), [Backend](https://github.com/DankoFox/aegis-backend) and [AI](https://github.com/nmquan1/aegis-pipeline).
